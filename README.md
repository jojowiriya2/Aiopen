I have developed my own Chat AI using the OpenAI API and specifically the text-davinci-003 model. This project has served as a valuable learning experience for understanding the usage of OpenAI and integrating it into web applications. However, it is important to note that due to a recent update, users are now required to add payment methods in order to access and utilize the OpenAI API key effectively.
